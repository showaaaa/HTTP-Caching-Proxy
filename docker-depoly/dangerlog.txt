Danger log:

1. After my proxy receive response from server and send it back to client, if the response contains content length, the client will send a sigpipe signal to my proxy.
Then my proxy will be stuck at that while loop.

     I found i sent more data than the content length specify, then client close the connect. Then I refactor my send receive logic and use the len variable to send what i just received. 

2. For cache part, i used read write lock. In get function, when there is no cached response, i just return nullptr in advance, which not enter the logic to unlock.
Then my program stuck for next request.

    i add unlock before this return.


3. For cache, i found my cached content is not same as what i store.

    Since i create the Response object without new, the object is deconstruced when function return. Therefore, my cached content is not correct. 
    I used new to make the content on heap.



4. For connect method, after select return, if FD_ISSET(fd[i], &read_fds) return true for that certain fd, i call receive from that fd. If the received length is less than or equal to 0,
i immediately close the fd to the server. Then my proxy can load youtube page or certain video page, but the video is always loading.

    i don't know why. But when i delete the immediately close code, the video can play well.


5. My thread number and sbuf number is set to 10 at the beginning. When configure my browser to use my proxy, when i visit youtube, soemtimes the page was stuck and super slow.

    I increased the thread number and sbuf number to 100, the page was faster and not stuck. I found when i open youtube home page, there are many request occurred. I guess there might
    be some javascrit or something else request some resource.
